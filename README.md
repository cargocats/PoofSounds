# Poof Sounds

Adds in poof sounds from Minecraft: Story Mode whenever a mob dies

## Changing sounds

You can change the sounds of the mod by creating a resource pack, and overwriting the `sounds.json` and adding in your own poof sounds to `poofsound/sounds`.

## Entity blacklist

You can configure the mod through a data pack to change if the mob should play the poof sound effect or not. The tag file is located at `data/poofsound/tags/entity_type/no_poof_sound.json`.
